I’m Diogo, originally from São José dos Campos, São Paulo, though until recently I was living in Itajubá, Minas Gerais, where I studied Computer Engineering at UNIFEI. Now, I’m continuing my academic journey at Mines de Nancy in France. From a young age, I’ve been driven by curiosity and a deep passion for improving things, always looking for real-world solutions that make sense. My core belief is simple: "Don’t be afraid." This has shaped how I approach life, challenges, and even casual conversations, transforming me from a shy person into someone who can talk to anyone about anything.

During high school, something shifted in me. I realized that the fear of others' opinions held no power over me. With that mindset, I’ve faced the world head-on, using obstacles to uncover personal growth opportunities. I currently hold an internship at a data company in the electrical sector (although I can’t disclose the name), where my responsibilities include finding efficient solutions in my role as a Computer Engineering student. At Mines de Nancy, I embrace all tasks that come my way, continuously striving to excel in everything I do.

Before diving fully into computer engineering, I ran Angels Audiovisual, where I learned the importance of strategic thinking. As the head of my company, I moved from hands-on operations to more tactical decision-making. Beyond this entrepreneurial chapter, I’ve had the honor of earning a scholarship to Mines de Nancy and achieving recognition in several academic competitions, such as winning honors at Sapientia for helping deaf individuals experience music through technology and earning silver at the International Youth Math Challenge in 2020.

Looking ahead, my goal is simple: to make an impact. I aim to work with Machine Learning and Python to address humanity’s biggest challenges. Over the next few years, I see myself evolving from mastering the technical aspects of my field to taking on more managerial roles. I want to be the person who not only understands the underlying technology but also leads and manages teams to bring innovative solutions to life.

At the heart of my professional journey is an unwavering philosophy: "Every human being was born for greatness." I believe success comes from learning through failures and that curiosity fuels progress. I live by the mindset that we are all students, always learning, and I seek out mentorship wherever possible to keep growing. My drive to understand the world and make it better is what keeps me going, whether it's through code, conversation, or collaboration.
