# Today I Learned (TIL) Repository

This repository is a collection of my daily learnings, following the **TIL (Today I Learned)** practice. The purpose of this project is to document new knowledge, insights, or discoveries I come across every day, no matter how big or small.

## Why TIL?

Adopting a TIL habit is a great way to reinforce learning and improve long-term knowledge retention. It encourages a continuous learning mindset, where even small insights or improvements are valued and documented. Sharing these learnings publicly, or even privately, fosters a culture of transparency, accountability, and growth.

By committing to documenting my learnings regularly, I not only track my progress but also create a valuable resource that I can revisit in the future or share with others who may benefit.

### Benefits of a TIL Practice:
1. **Reinforces Learning**: Writing down new concepts solidifies understanding.
2. **Promotes Consistency**: A daily habit of learning creates a routine that keeps curiosity alive.
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Helps others learn from your experiences and discoveries.
4. **Increases Awareness**: Even the small, seemingly trivial lessons contribute to overall knowledge.
5. **Documentation for Future Reference**: A TIL repository serves as a personal knowledge base to look back on.

## Getting Started

This repository uses the **Chirpy** theme for easy and efficient content management with Jekyll, ensuring that each entry is neatly formatted and well-organized.
