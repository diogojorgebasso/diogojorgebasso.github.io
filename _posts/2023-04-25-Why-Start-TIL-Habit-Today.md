## Introduction

Have you ever stumbled upon a cool fact or learned something new and thought, "Wow, that's interesting!"? Well, you're not alone! TIL, or Today I Learned, is a trend that started on Reddit and has since spread to other platforms like Twitter and Github, where people share their interesting and educational discoveries. It's a concept that I've been using for a while now, with ups and downs, but I've decided for the sake of perseverance to start sharing it with the world. While it may seem like just a trend, TIL is a great way to cultivate a habit of learning and personal growth.

## Why is it a great Habit?

As an undergraduate, I often found it hard to stay motivated and focused on my studies, especially when living away from my family and friends. But by writing down what I learned each day, I was able to stay on track and even reflect on my progress! TIL provided a way for me to track my growth and **build perseverance** by focusing on one thing and consistently doing it; a great way to keep me accountable for my main objective.

## How to start?

If you're hesitant to share your thoughts or content with others, don't worry! I know the feeling too. But trust me, the best way to overcome this feeling is to simply start. I mean, we all feel insecure to meet a new person, talk about something in a group, or even share our thoughts with our friends. It is a natural feeling, and it is okay to feel that way. However, I've learned that the best way to overcome this feeling is to "just do it". I encourage you to start writing your TIL, even if it is just for yourself. You can use a notebook, a text editor, or even a Github repository, like this one. The important thing is to start and be consistent. You can always improve your writing skills, but you can't improve something that doesn't even exist.

## Benefits of TIL

By sharing through TIL what you learned each day, you can reinforce your knowledge and expand your understanding of various topics. And who knows? Sharing your TIL may even spark conversations and connections with others who share similar interests, creating a community around it. By [creating content](https://diogojorgebasso.github.io/posts/how-marketing-on-social-media-works) you gain social proof of your ability; you create authority in your niche. This is for example a great way for you to sell your products or services.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, life is all about learning and growing, and TIL is a simple yet powerful tool that can help you do just that. By sharing your newfound knowledge with others, you not only help yourself but also contribute to a larger community of learners who are passionate about expanding their horizons. So why not give it a try? Who knows what amazing discoveries await you on your TIL journey...
