# My Journey: From Videomaker to Engineer

For the past two years, I balanced my passion for videography with my studies in computer engineering. During this time, I ran my own audiovisual company, working on various projects and gaining valuable experience in storytelling, production, and the technical aspects of videomaking.

## A Major Decision

However, this year, I made the decision to fully commit to my engineering career. I chose to close my audiovisual company and focus on new opportunities that align with my long-term goals. The transition wasn’t easy, but I knew it was the right step.

## A Scholarship to Mines de Nancy

The biggest change came when I earned a scholarship to study at **Mines de Nancy** —a renowned institution in France. It’s an incredible opportunity to dive deeper into computer engineering, surrounded by some of the brightest minds in the field.

## A New Chapter Begins

This transition marks the beginning of a new chapter for me. While I’ll always value my time as a videomaker, I’m excited to focus on advancing my engineering skills and making the most of my time here in France. I’m ready to take on new challenges and fully immerse myself in this next phase of my journey.

This article talks a little about how I earned a spot in the CAPES/BRAFITEC program to study as a scholarship student at the École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Nancy. It's an experience that fills me with pride and excitement.

### History

It was the year 2020, right in the middle of the pandemic. I had just been rejected from the Quantum Computing Summer Course at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Yes, quantum computing! At the time, it seemed very attractive to me, as I’ve always been a bit of a dreamer.

However, it was during the pandemic, and I had bigger problems to deal with, so I didn’t worry much, though the desire to study abroad was always there. I accepted it and moved on.

### Discovering BRAFITEC

Later, during my second year at university, I came across an email from UNIFEI about a program called “BRAFITEC.” It required French language skills, a high GPA (around 7.5-9), and to be between 40%-80% of the course completed.

I thought, “Maybe next year.” But eventually, it caught my attention more. I started studying French more seriously, raised my grades, and by the end of the year, I took the DELF proficiency exam and got 50/100, enough to get certified. It was a blessing.

### Choosing a University

After learning more about the program, I faced the paradox of choice. I had options like Polytech in Lille, Marseille, and Orléans. But then [Professor Dr. Tales Pimenta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CrD6ozsAAAAJ&hl=en) informed me that Mines de Nancy had spots open for a different program. After researching, I found out it’s a “Grande École,” the highest academic status in France, and ranked 4th in computer science in the country. Wow!

I switched to apply for Mines de Nancy, submitted my documents, and was accepted!

### Receiving the Scholarship

I want to sincerely thank [CAPES](https://www.capes.gov.br/) for making this opportunity possible. This scholarship is not just a personal achievement but a significant step in my professional growth.
